I'm an economist and policy scholar currently serving in a Limited Term Faculty position in the Department of Economics at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada. I completed my PhD in Public Policy at the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota in 2022.

I have expertise in applied microeconomics research in the fields of public and labor economics. My research agenda focuses on occupational regulation.
